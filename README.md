ASK Modulation: BER vs. SNR Analysis
This project simulates the Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) modulation. It compares the simulated BER with the theoretical BER to analyze the performance of ASK over different SNR values.

üìÇ Project Structure
ask_ber_vs_snr.py: Main Python code for simulating and plotting BER vs. SNR.
README.md: Documentation for the project.

BER vs. SNR Plot:
The plot compares the simulated and theoretical BER as SNR increases.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
ASK Modulation:

Input bits (0 or 1) are transmitted as symbols (0 or 1).
Noise Addition:

Gaussian noise is added to the transmitted symbols to simulate a noisy channel.
Decision Process:

The receiver decides whether the received signal represents 1 (if greater than 0.5) or 0.
BER Calculation:

Simulated BER is calculated by comparing transmitted and received bits.
Theoretical BER is computed using the Q-function.
üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Modify num_bits to change the number of bits simulated.
Adjust the snr_db_range to analyze a broader or narrower SNR range.
